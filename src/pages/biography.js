          At the turn of the century, a new era began in Detroit. A two piece
          set out to join the fray in making original technical death metal. But
          with a few new twists they learned over their North American travels.
          By emulsifying their punk, thrash, and metal roots with Canadian and
          Florida death metal madness, they knew they were on to something.
          Something, from a different planet perhaps?
          <br />
          <br />
          From the infernal fires of hell and chaos came a vision of a sound so
          unrelenting and unpredictable, most humans tried to shut out the
          sound. Was it out of fear? Shame? Guilt?
          <br />
          <br />
          Ultimately, many could not deny the feeling of darkness that pervaded
          their souls long after they heard the sounds. They felt a strange
          comfort. It was as if someone, or something, knew exactly how they
          felt.
          <br />
          <br />
          Rumors swirled around the abyss as old and young alike realized that
          this sound spoke to a feeling they all shared. More than just a
          feeling, it was an emotion. It was discord. It was the Hand of Eris
          <br />
          <br />
          The hive celebrated knowing justice has finally been served. The
          selfish, self-centered pieces of human filth that had kept the
          people's lives under foot were now made to feel the burn of the
          flames. Life for them would never be the same. With daily sacrifices
          to their new Lord, the people knew their voices would only be heard,
          but felt.
